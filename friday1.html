      <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p>
     Hello everyone, I'm <strong>JohnPaul</strong>. I was born on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2000 in a village known as Ndiiri in Ndaragwa constituency, Nyandarua County. I am the lastborn among my four older siblings. I started studying at <em>Pondo primary school</em> then to <em>Stones View acadamey</em> and did my KCPE at <em>Nyandarua Boarding primary School</em>. I later went to <em>Njabini Boys High School</em> and did my KCSE. I will be joining <em>Technical University of Kenya</em> at September admissions but now am at <strong><em>Moringa School</em></strong>. <br/> These is how I heard about Moringa School.
    </P>

      I finished High School last year,while in High School I heard about coding due to my frequency of watching documentaries, I knew coding is the future. I related many tech companies started due to coding lke <em>Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Google, Amazon, e.t.c</em>. My urge of studying coding increased, which led me to find for a school where I can study coding.<br/> I found out <strong><em>Moringa school</strong></em> to be the only best coding school in Africa. After High School I became a self taught learner of coding where I would read many coding books, practice so much. By knowing <strong><em>Moringa school</strong></em> I knew my desires have been satisfied. <hr>
